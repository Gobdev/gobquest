# Gobquest

Gobquest is in part a text based game engine, and in part it's own game. To write a game with the Gobquest engine, you need only 
create .gob files in a directory, according to the specification found in doc/ .  

## Features
There are very few features in the engine at the moment, since it is currently under development. Flags and rooms are being 
implemented right now, with plans of implementing NPC's and events afterwards. To get a general idea of the code layout, view 
the flow chart that is found in doc/ .
