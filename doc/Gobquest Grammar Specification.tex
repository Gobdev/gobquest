    \section{Flags}
        The flags in Gobquest are used to deny access to certain points
        before some requirements have been completed. Flags can be set 
        as a result of a quest step completion or NPC interaction. They 
        can be checked when selecting which exits and NPC's should be 
        available in a room, and which conversation options should be 
        available with an NPC. The default value given to a flag is 
        the value the flag will have when the game is started with an 
        empty save file.

                start          & = & flag start \textbar\ EOF \\
                flag           & = & name default\_value \\
                name           & = & string \\
                default\_value & = & true \textbar\ false
            \end{tabular}

    \section{Rooms}
        Rooms in Gobquest contain all the other objects (with flags being 
        an exception, since they are a program state). Each room will also 
        have connections to other rooms, containing the name of the exit 
        that is shown to the player, and the room name that this exit 
        takes the player to. These exits can vary in a room 
        depending on which flags are set for the player, which means that 
        areas can be locked off until a certain point in the game is 
        reached. The same thing can be applied to NPC's, locking certain 
        NPC interactions until it is appropriate in the game.

                start & = & name exits start \textbar\ EOF \\
                name  & = & string \\
                exits & = & exit exits \textbar\ $\epsilon$ \\\\

                exit       & = & exit\_name path requirements exit \textbar\ $\epsilon$ \\
                exit\_name   & = & string \\
                path         & = & string \\
                requirements & = & flag requirements \textbar\ $\epsilon$
